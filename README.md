# FairTest 🔍
Welcome to the repository of FairTest, an award-winning project that brings creative solution to university/shcool online testing.

## Inspiration 💭
As university students, we noticed that when the education became remote due to COVID-19 pandemic, exams and tests went hard to be monitored by university/school. The issue appeared such that students became more inactive in terms of study and cheatings became hard to track, which is really unfair to all students. Therefore, we built FairTest from scratch, an online testing platform to solve this problem. Our project focuses on the productivity track on the hackathon and we believe that, providing a more fair and strict testing system will motivate the student to learn more actively online and behave in an honest manner on the tests/exams.
